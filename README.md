# 🎵 Music Recommender Simulation

## Project Summary

In this project you will build and explain a small music recommender system.

Your goal is to:

- Represent songs and a user "taste profile" as data
- Design a scoring rule that turns that data into recommendations
- Evaluate what your system gets right and wrong
- Reflect on how this mirrors real world AI recommenders

Replace this paragraph with your own summary of what your version does.

## How The System Works

Explain your design in plain language.

Some prompts to answer:

- What features does each `Song` use in your system
  - For example: genre, mood, energy, tempo
- What information does your `UserProfile` store
- How does your `Recommender` compute a score for each song
- How do you choose which songs to recommend

The real-world recommendation utilizes collaborative filter and content-based filtering to make recommendations for the users. The collaborative filtering will reference other users with similar preferences to make recommendations for the songs. The content-based filtering make recomendations on the different features. The features each 'song' use in my system includes genre, mood, and energy. Since 'Song' uses genre, mood, energy, it is important to store the favorite genre, favorite mood, and energy level in 'UserProfile'. The 'Recommender' compute a score for each song by adding +2 points if the Genre Match the user's favorite genre, +1 if it matches the user's favorite mood, and + up to 1 point the closer the energy matches. To choose which songs to recommend, after computing a score for each song, the songs are sorted, the top songs are then recommended first.

### Algorithm Recipe
Each song will start with a score of 0, if the genre matches the score will increase by 2, and if the mood matches, the score will increase by 1. The closer the value of the energy the higher the score, with the most increasing the score by 1 point. 

The system will prioritize genre over mood and energy since a matching genre will give +2 points. As a result, other songs that match the user's mood or energy may be ignored.

## Getting Started

### Setup

1. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate      # Mac or Linux
   .venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows

2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the app:

```bash
python -m src.main
```

### Running Tests

Run the starter tests with:

```bash
pytest
```

You can add more tests in `tests/test_recommender.py`.

## Sample Recommendation Output

Paste a sample of your recommender's output here as a text block so a reader can see what it produces:

```text
Loaded songs: 18

====================================================
  TOP RECOMMENDATIONS FOR YOU
  genre=pop  mood=happy  energy=0.8
====================================================

  1. Sunrise City - Neon Echo
     Score: 3.98
     Reasons:
       - genre match (pop) (+2.0)
       - mood match (happy) (+1.0)
       - energy closeness (song 0.82 vs target 0.80) (+0.98)

  2. Gym Hero - Max Pulse
     Score: 2.87
     Reasons:
       - genre match (pop) (+2.0)
       - energy closeness (song 0.93 vs target 0.80) (+0.87)

  3. Rooftop Lights - Indigo Parade
     Score: 1.96
     Reasons:
       - mood match (happy) (+1.0)
       - energy closeness (song 0.76 vs target 0.80) (+0.96)

  4. Concrete Prophet - Iron Verse
     Score: 1.00
     Reasons:
       - energy closeness (song 0.80 vs target 0.80) (+1.00)

  5. Night Drive Loop - Neon Echo

## Experiments You Tried

Use this section to document the experiments you ran. For example:

- What happened when you changed the weight on genre from 2.0 to 0.5
- What happened when you added tempo or valence to the score
- How did your system behave for different types of users

---

## Limitations and Risks

Summarize some limitations of your recommender.

Examples:

- It only works on a tiny catalog
- It does not understand lyrics or language
- It might over favor one genre or mood

You will go deeper on this in your model card.

## Reflection

Read and complete `model_card.md`:

[**Model Card**](model_card.md)

Write 1 to 2 paragraphs here about what you learned:

- about how recommenders turn data into predictions
- about where bias or unfairness could show up in systems like this
